# Monitor Configuration
# See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/
# List current monitors: hyprctl monitors
# Format: monitor = [port], resolution, position, scale

# Current setup: 4K primary + 1440p portrait secondary
# DP-2 scaled to 1.25 for readable text on 4K (logical: 3072x1728)
# HDMI-A-1 positioned at 3072 (after scaled DP-2) in portrait mode
monitor=DP-2,3840x2160@119,0x0,1.25
monitor=HDMI-A-1,2560x1440@143,3072x0,1,transform,1

# Alternative scaling options for 4K monitor:
# For 27" 4K (more readable but smaller workspace):
# monitor=DP-2,3840x2160@119,0x0,1.5

# For 32" 4K (slightly scaled for comfort):
# monitor=DP-2,3840x2160@119,0x0,1.25

# For very close viewing or small text preference:
# monitor=DP-2,3840x2160@119,0x0,2

# Workspace binding - odd workspaces on primary, even on side
